# 1.5 Version
The purpose of this version is to create an abstract base class called *Zmogus*, so that class *Studentas* would be derived from the base class. 

## Abstract class
The abstract base class has two protected variables *vardas* and *pavarde*. A Studentas type object heritages a student's name and surname from the base class. 
Class *Zmogus* also has a constructor, destructor and two virtual string type functions (getters for name and surname).
