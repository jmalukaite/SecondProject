# 1.2 Version
 The purpose of this version is to implement the *RULE OF THREE* in version 1.1 using class. The biggest difference from 1.1 version is that in *studentas.h* destructor, copy constructor and copy assignment constructor were added. For the copy assignment constructor a function called *swap* was created. The destructor is set on default. If some kind of phrase to be printed is written in the destructor, in the Run area it is seen that destructor is called many times.
