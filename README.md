# 2.0 Version
In this version there is an included documentation (made using *Doxygen*)in html and a source link. Also, in the project a test can be found to check whether a setter and getter works correctly.

## Doxygen
The 1.5 version was documentated using doxygen. In the documentation, information about classes, functions, various comments can be found.

## Tests
In the new version there is a test for getter and setter. For the test to work correctly, googletest was downloaded from github through computer terminal. The CMakeList was modified by hand (few lines added). The required files for googletest to work were saved in a new folder called *lib* (the folder is on my computer due to its large size).
